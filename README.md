# Car Price Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahmetcalis/car-price-prediction).

## Getting Started

This repository uses Python 3.11

- The `requirements.txt` is provided to install dependencies easily.

## Usage

1. Download and install **Anaconda** from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install).
2. Open Anaconda and create a new environment:

```bash
conda create --name car_price_prediction python=3.11
conda activate car_price_prediction
```

3. Install Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

4. Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahmetcalis/car-price-prediction) and place it in the same directory as the analysis code.
6. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:

```bash
jupyter notebook Car Price Prediction.ipynb
```

7. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and analyze its performance.
